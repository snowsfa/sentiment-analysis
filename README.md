# Sentiment Analysis - Machine Learning

This project contemplates two approaches of data analyses that considers different types of data classification. It can be used for Sentiment Analysis based on Machine Learning. This solution could be useful to identify a sentiment in several cases, for example:

+ Sentiment of collaborators on a project management system;
+ Sentiment of users on a social media network;
+ Sentiment of customers about the meals of a restaurant;

This is my first contact with the Machine Learning Development and my objective is trying to show my abilities as a fast learner and my back-end development skills.

###Classifications

Based on training inputs, this solution build a model and classifies sentiments in two different classification types.

#####Binary Classification 
                    
Sentiment  | Value
------------- | -------------
Positive  | 1
Negative  | 0


#####Multiclass Classification 

Sentiment  | Value
------------- | -------------
Very Positive  | 2
Positive  | 1
Neutral | 0
Negative  | -1
Very Negative  | -2
